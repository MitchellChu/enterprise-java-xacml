Refactory notes:
0.The implementation should based on XML. The XML should come from file or other InputStream.
1.Refactor the DataAdapter/DataStore interface to return a generic PolicySet/Policy element or other objects. Also need refactory related FileDataAdapter.
2.Move evaluation logic from Policy/Expression/Other policy elements to specific evaluators.
3.Refactory engine classes, make the flow clearly. Such as refactor the context factory and so on.
	a.Context should be an interface, then we can provide different impls while we run the PDP in different environments. Context is using to carry XACML Request/Attributes/Services provided by environments.
	b.Request/Response should has original XML document, if no, we should have ability to build one from scratch.
4.Create a branch to save the refactory codes.
5.Maintain the 2 braches, also need fix bug on the original branch.
